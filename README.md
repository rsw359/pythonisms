# LAB - Class 42

## Project: Pythonisms

### Author: Roger Wells

### The aim of this lab is to demonstrate the use of dunder methods and decorators in Python

- Findings:

  - Dunder iter can make non iterable objects iterable by using a generator
  - Dunder str can return a string representation of a dataset
  - Dunder len can return the length of the dataset, even a non iterable object after it has been modified
  - Dunder eq can compare two datasets
  - Dunder methods are magic!
  - Decorators can be used to do all kinds of things based on what you design them to do. They are quite versatile!
